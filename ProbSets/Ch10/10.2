According to Dee Brown, Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee (New York: Washington Square Press, 1981), 153 Native Americans are known to have been killed in the massacre at Wounded Knee, although the actual number may well be as high as 300. Only twenty-five U. S. soldiers were killed, most of them by "friendly fire" from other soldiers. According to Brown, the soldiers ordered the Native Americans to give up their rifles, but a young Minneconjou named Black Coyote did not give up his rifle. Some eyewitnesses say that Black Coyote opened fire on the soldiers, others say he was deaf and did not understand the soldiers. Therefore, based on this information, we may conclude that Black Coyote started the incident at Wounded Knee by firing on the soldiers.::::appropriate authority
