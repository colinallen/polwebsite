Part C: English Arguments Symbolize the following arguments, using the schemes of abbreviation provided. Then use CP to show that the arguments are valid.1. If Jones doesn’t vote, then he shouldn’t vote. For after all, if Jones doesn’t vote, then either he lacks intelligence or he lacks a proper value system. And Jones shouldn’t vote if he lacks intelligence. Furthermore, Jones shouldn’t vote if he lacks a proper value system. (V: Jones does vote; I: Jones has intelligence; P: Jones has a proper value system; S: Jones should vote) 2. Euthanasia is wrong if either the patient prefers to go on living or she still maintains her higher faculties. Therefore, if the patient still maintains her higher faculties, then euthanasia is wrong. (P: The patient prefers to go on living; F: The patient maintains her higher faculties; E: Euthanasia is wrong) 3. If we should forgive our enemies, then it is wrong to punish criminals. For if we should forgive our enemies, then we should forget the offense and behave as if the offense never occurred. And we should punish criminals if and only if we should not behave as if the offense never occurred. Furthermore, it is wrong to punish criminals if and only if we should not punish criminals. (F: We should forgive our enemies; W: It is wrong to punish criminals; O: We should forget the offense; B: We should behave as if the offense never occurred; S: We should punish criminals) 4. If God believes on Monday that I’ll tell a lie on Tuesday, then either I have the power to make one of God’s past beliefs false or I cannot refrain from lying on Tuesday. I do not have the power to make one of God’s past beliefs false if either God is infallible or the past is unalterable. The past is unalterable. It follows that if God believes on Monday that I’ll tell a lie on Tuesday, then I cannot refrain from lying on Tuesday. (B: God believes on Monday that I’ll tell a lie on Tuesday; F: I have the power to make one of God’s past beliefs false; R: I can refrain from lying on Tuesday; I: God is infallible; P: The past is unalterable) 5. If humans lack free will, then there is no moral responsibility. Materialism is true if and only if only matter exists. Assuming that only matter exists, every event is the result of past states of the world plus the operation of natural laws. Now, if every event is the result of past states of the world plus the operation of natural laws, then human acts are under human control only if either humans have control over the past or humans have control over the natural laws. Humans do not have control over the past, and they do not have control over the natural laws. Finally, if human acts are not under human control, then humans do not have free will. We may conclude that if materialism is true, then there is no moral responsibility. (F: Humans have free will; R: There is moral responsibility; M: Materialism is true; O: Only matter exists; E: Every event is the result of past states of the world plus the operation of natural laws; C: Human acts are under human control; P: Humans have control over the past; N: Humans have control over the natural laws)
