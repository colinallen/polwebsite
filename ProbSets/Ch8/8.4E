Part E: Valid or Invalid? Symbolize the following arguments. If an argument is invalid, prove this by means of an abbreviated truth table. If an argument is valid, construct a proof to demonstrate its validity. 1. If either moral judgments are products of biological causes or moral judgments are not based on empirical evidence, then morality is not objective. But if moral judgments are not products of biological causes, then moral judgments are not based on empirical evidence. Hence, morality is not objective. (M: Moral judgments are products of biological causes; E: Moral judgments are based on empirical evidence; O: Morality is objective) 2. It is false that if we continue to use gasoline, then the air will not be polluted. Either we do not continue to use gasoline or we use solar power. If we continue to use gasoline and air-pollution control devices are perfected, then the air will not be polluted. Therefore, we use solar power if and only if air-pollution control devices are perfected. (G: We continue to use gasoline; A: The air will be polluted; S: We use solar power; P: Air-pollution control devices are perfected) 3. Given that Henri Rousseau’s The Dream is pornographic if and only if Rousseau painted it with the intention of inciting lust in the viewers, Rousseau’s The Dream is not pornographic. For Rousseau painted it with the intention of inciting lust in the viewers only if every nude painting is painted with the intention of inciting lust in the viewers. And the latter suggestion is wildly false! (P: Henri Rousseau’s The Dream is pornographic; L: Rousseau painted The Dream with the intention of inciting lust in the viewers; N: Every nude painting is painted with the intention of inciting lust in the viewers) 4. If Boethius is morally virtuous, then he achieves heaven. But if he isn’t morally virtuous, then his longings are satisfied. On the other hand, if Boethius doesn’t achieve heaven, then his longings are not satisfied. So, Boethius’s longings are satisfied. (M: Boethius is morally virtuous; H: Boethius achieves heaven; L: Boethius’s longings are satisfied) 5. Either God has a reason for his commands or morality is ultimately arbitrary. If God has a reason for his commands, then reasons that are independent of God’s will make actions right. Consequently, reasons that are independent of God’s will make actions right provided that morality is not ultimately arbitrary. (R: God has a reason for his commands; M: Morality is ultimately arbitrary; I: Reasons that are independent of God’s will make actions right)
