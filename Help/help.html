<h3>General Help</h3>

The Power of Logic web site is primarily designed for students to
assess their understanding of materials in the text book and to
practice the new skills taught in courses based on the book.

<p>

The purpose of online help is not to provide instruction in logic, but
to explain how to use the components of the program.

<h4>Typing special symbols</h4>

Some of the symbols used in chapters 7-9 are not on the keyboard and
cannot easily be shown in html.  Here is what you should type instead:

<table style="border: 1px solid green; padding: 5px;">

<tr><td style="border: 1px solid green; text-align: center;">&rarr;</td>
<td><strong>arrow</strong></td>
<td>"<tt>-&gt;</tt>" (dash + greater than),
or simply "<tt>&gt;</tt>" </td></tr>

<tr><td style="border: 1px solid green; text-align: center;">&harr;</td>
<td><strong>double arrow</strong></td>
<td>"<tt>&lt;-&gt;</tt>"  (less than + dash + greater than),
or simply "<tt>&lt;</tt>"</td></tr>

<h3>Unable to Stay Logged In</h3>

<p>

Some users find they are unable to stay logged in to the Power of
Logic site when they enter via PageOut (pageout.net).  This problem
appears to be caused either by incorrect cookie privacy settings or a
problem with the way time is being set on your computer.  If you are
having this problem, one of following solutions should work.

<h5>Problem 1: Cookie Privacy Settings</h5>

<p>

<ul>
<li> <b>Internet Explorer</b>: To check your these settings in Internet
Explorer choose &ldquo;Internet Options&rdquo; under the &ldquo;Tools&rdquo; menu, and click
on the tab labeled &ldquo;Privacy&rdquo;.  If your setting is anything other than
&ldquo;Accept all cookies&rdquo; or &ldquo;Low&rdquo; then the poweroflogic cookies will
automatically be rejected.  You can prevent this either by moving the
slider to one of the two lowest settings, or you may leave your
privacy settings on something higher and set a specific exception for
www.poweroflogic.com by clicking on &ldquo;Edit&rdquo; near at the bottom of the
panel, and then entering &ldquo;poweroflogic.com&rdquo; and clicking
&ldquo;Allow&rdquo;. Click &ldquo;Apply&rdquo; and &ldquo;OK&rdquo; to finish. You will then need to
re-enter the site from pageout.net.</li>

<li><b>Mozilla Firefox</b>: To check your these settings in Mozilla
Firefox, choose Tools -> Options -> Privacy -> Cookies from the
Firefox menu.  (If you are using an Apple computer running OS X,
choose &ldquo;Preferences&rdquo; from the Firefox menubar and click on the
&ldquo;Privacy&rdquo; tab in the dialog box.)  Set your browser to
accept cookies &ldquo;For the originating site only&rdquo;.  (If that
does not work, try allowing cookes from all sites.)  Click
&ldquo;OK&rdquo; to finish and re-enter the Power of Logic site from
PageOut.
</li>
</ul>

<h5>Problem 2: Date/Time Settings</h5>

<p>The second appears only in Internet Explorer, and it occurs if your
computer is not automatically synchronizing its date/time
automatically via the internet.  There are two solutions to this
problem.

<ol>
<li>
Use Firefox instead of Internet Explorer.  Firefox can be downloaded
and used free of charge from <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org">http://www.mozilla.org</a>.  (This is
perhaps a good idea in any case, as Firefox is generally considered to
be much safer to use on the internet than Internet Explorer.)  </li>

<li>
Set your computer to automatically synchronize its date/time with an
internet time server.  You can find instructions at <a
href="http://theillustratednetwork.mvps.org/Time/TimeSync.html">http://theillustratednetwork.mvps.org/Time/TimeSync.html</a>.
</li> </ol>

</p>

<p>
If the above instructions do not solve the problem, please send email
to <a
href="mailto:webmaster@poweroflogic.com">webmaster@poweroflogic.com</a>
with answers to the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What operating system are you using? (e.g. Windows 7)</li>
<li>What web browser and version are you using? (e.g. Internet Explorer 9.0)</li>
<li>Do you have the problem with other browsers? (e.g. Firefox, Safari, Chrome)</li>
<li>Exactly what steps are you taking to get to the poweroflogic site?
   (e.g. which PageOut page are you starting from?)</li>
<li>After you've connected to poweroflogic.com, does your login id and
   course id information get displayed below the menu?</li>
<li>Assuming the information is there initially, does it persist at
   all, or does it drop the first time you follow another link?</li>
<li>If it does persist at all, what is the exact sequence of steps leading to
   the information disappearing?</li>
</ol>
