<h4>General information about Venn Diagrams</h4>

<p> <strong>Venn Diagrams</strong> are used to represent the premises of a
syllogism.

<strong>Apples</strong>

<strong>Bland Things</strong>

<center><strong>Crunchy Things</strong></center>
</td>
<td width=160>

<p> Premises that describe general relationships between classes, such
as that <em>`All crunchy things are apples'</em>, are represented by
shading out parts of the diagram that cannot be occupied if the
premise is true.

<p> Premises that describe the existence of a particular object, such
as `some Apples are bland', are represented by placing an
<strong>X</strong> in the appropriate part of the diagram.  Sometimes,
the <strong>X</strong> must be placed on the border of two areas,
representing uncertainty about its location.

<p> The validity of a syllogism is checked by diagramming the premises
and then looking to see whether the conclusion is represented by the
constructed diagram.
