<h3>Completing a Truth Table</h3>

  <p> Upon selecting a truth table exercise, one is presented with an
  incomplete truth table like this one:</p>

  <p>
    <center>

    </center></p>
    
  <p> The top line of the incomplete truth table contains the
  statement letters contained in the argument, a vertical line, and
  the sentence or argument for which the truth table is to be
  constructed.  The next line contains a separator -- basically a row
  of dashes and a single vertical line.  Beginning on the third line,
  beneath the statement letters appear the 2<sup><em>n</em></sup>
  possible distinct truth value assignments that can be given for the
  statement letters.  (Because there is such a simple algorithm for
  constructing these truth value assigments, we decided to relieve you
  of the tedium of constructing them yourself -- <em>but be sure you
  know how to construct them on your own!</em> You will need to know
  how to to do this on your exams.)  To complete each row correctly,
  follow these two guidelines:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
	Enter a truth value (i.e., <tt>T</tt> or &nbsp;<tt>F</tt>) under
	each logical operator.</li>
      <li>
	Do not enter a truth value beneath a statement letter
	<em>unless</em> the statement letter by itself is either one
	of the premises or the conclusion of the argument</em>.</li>
    </ol>
    
    Thus, following these guidelines a correct first row will look
    like this:

    <p>
      <center>

      </center></p>

    <p> Filling out each row in similar fashion, a completed truth
    table will look like this:</p>

    <p>
      <center>
	<img SRC="/Images/TT/tt3.gif">
      </center></p>

    <p> Clicking on the `Check Truth Table Now!' button will do just
    that, i.e., it will check to see that you have filled in the truth
    table correctly.  If you have not, you should get a useful
    response telling you what went wrong, and a copy of your truth
    table in a new box in which you can make the necessary
    correction.</p>

<h3>Determining Validity</h3>

    <p> Once your truth table is correct, you will be presented with a
    page that asks you to assess its validity.  The relevant portion
    of the page looks like this:</p>

    <p>
      <center>

      </center></p>

    <p> As noted in Section 7.3 of the text, to test for validity, you
    look to see whether or not there is a row of the table on which
    the premises of the argument are true and the conclusion false.
    If you do not find such a row, the argument is valid, so click on
    the `Valid' button to complete the exercise.  If you have missed
    such a row you will be so informed and presented with your errant
    truth table for you to fix.  If you do find such a row, check the
    checkbox to its left, as indicated in our example:</p>

    <p>
      <center>
	<img SRC="/Images/TT/tt5.gif">
      </center></p>

    <p> You may then either click on the `Invalid' button (one row is
    all you need to establish invalidity) or you may continue to
    search for further invalidating rows.  If you miss any such rows,
    the program will tell you your answer is correct, but will give
    you the opportunity to find the invalidating rows that remain.  In
    either case, if you have checked a row that does not invalidate
    the argument, you will again be so informed and presented with
    your errant truth table.  If you are correct, enjoy the praise
    that will be heaped upon you!
